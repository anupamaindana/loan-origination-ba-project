2. Purpose of the Document
The purpose of this BRD is to define the business requirements, process flows, functional expectations, and scope for implementing a fully Automated Loan Origination System (LOS) for retail loans.
The system aims to reduce manual work, improve TAT, automate KYC & CIBIL checks, and streamline approvals through a digital workflow.

3. Project Overview
3.1 Background
The bank’s current loan origination process is manual, paper-based, and dependent on branch staff. This causes delays, errors, and inconsistent decision-making.
A digital LOS is required to automate customer onboarding, verification, credit assessment, and loan disbursement.
3.2 Business Need
•	To reduce overall loan approval time
•	To meet increasing digital demand from customers
•	To ensure regulatory (RBI) compliant KYC verification
•	To reduce operational workload and cost
•	To improve underwriting accuracy and risk evaluation

4. Scope of Work
In Scope
•	Online loan application portal
•	KYC automation (Aadhaar + PAN validation API)
•	Bureau/CIBIL pull
•	Automated credit scoring engine
•	Underwriter review workflow
•	Approval engine
•	Disbursement initiation to Core Banking System (CBS)
•	Notifications (SMS, Email, App)
•	Loan status tracking dashboard
Out of Scope
